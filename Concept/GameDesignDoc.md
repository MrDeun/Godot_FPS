# Project for computer graphics - FPS Video game about Time-Travel (*Title PENDING*) 

## Introduction 
### + Game Summary
(**TITLE PENDING**) is a first person shooter inspired by a old-school shooter of the 90's and early 00's (Serious Sam, Quake) with a heavy focus on movement and main gimmick of Power Tome-like power-up.

Possible titles: "Barrels'o Time"
### + Inspiration
**Serious Sam** - setting of Time-Travel gives a liberty on what kind of world settings I am allowed to do. To addition, it gives me a idea to make it a horde shooters at times.

**Quake** - heavy inspiration when comes to graphics. Most of the models will be low poly with not a lot of detail although I don't want to make colors one tone aka. brown.

**Heretic** - Heretic's Tome of Power allows for player for a limited amount of time to power up their weapons. I'm gonna need to make scenarios that without such ablity would be a pretty diffcult to overcome. Although, usage of the power-up should NOT be a requirement.
### + Player Experience
It's First Person shooter with 3 episodes with 9 maps each including secret level in if player manages to find it. Each map should take around 2-5 minutes to complete. Player will be explore each level like a labyrinth, looking for keys to proceed to level futher.
### + Platform
Exclusivity on PC - first demo will probably be uploaded on itch.io and GameJolt. If the games will do some decent numbers I'll think of releasing the demo on Steam although I would need to pay 100$ fee which might be steep. Definetly not Epic - that platform kinda sucks.
### + Development Software
Main Engine - Godot Game Engine, capable of 3D, lightweight, easy to use.

3D Modeler - Blender or getting FREE assets from itch.io.

Audio - Audacity maybe? or again I'm gonna use assets from itch.io
### + Genre
Singleplayer, First-Person Shooter, Boomer Shooter
### + Target Audience
People who grew up playing such games and don't mind the chunky graphics. 
## Concept
### + Gameplay overview
### + Main Theme - Time Travel
Our protagonist is a soldier chosen to traveling in time to find a way to stop an alien invasion from taking over the galaxy. Through out his journey he will visit many diffrent civilnations.

Episode 1 - Egypt. Lot of yellow, exploring labyrinths of Pyramids

Episode 2 - Slavic Early Medieval - times of pagans, old settlements and maybe somekind of battles in the background.


Episode 3 - SPPAAAAACE. Final episodes
### + Primary Mechanics
Movement - Player is capable of basic 3D movement along with jumping and crounching.  

Shooting - Player wields an arsenal of weapons with a distinct feature of being unique and each having it's own role. If time will allow, maybe some kind of weapon exclusive to the time zone?

Enemies - could be a mix of enemies sent also in time by the alien race and enemies that a local to the timelines - mummies in Egypt's catacombs
### + Secondary Mechanics
Tome of Power thingy thing (not sure how to call it for now) - special time of power-up that player can use if he has enough charge. Charge regenerates passively with higher ranks on how stylishly players plays (avoids damage, kill enemies in succesion, uses diffrent type of weaponry etc.). Each effect on Tome of Power will behave diffrently depending on what kind of weapon player wields.
## Art
### + Design
Entire game will have a graphics that will resemble early times of 3D graphics, low poly with low resolution textures.

## Game Experience
### + UI
Simple, should show how much health and armor player has, his state on ammunition, currently wielding weapon, all of them put into a semi-transparent boxes with a color scheme resembling a current time period.
### + Weaponry
All of the weapons will have their own unique ammo pool. Each of the weapon should be unique enough should a player has a clear understanding of when the weapon is useful. Each episode should have a weapon that's unique to the period and is strong on it's own but ammo for it is rare and usage is gimmicky.

+ **KNIFE** - Basic knife for the times are desparete. Last effort that on it's own would be diffcult to play the game.
+ + POWER UP: Chainsaw. Player revs up the chainsaw - any damage done with it makes enemies drop health vials.
+ **MAGNUM** - First gun that player finds. Slow but packing a decent punch and accurate. Later on player can find a upgrade that adds a scope for it to make long-distance shots.  

+ + POWER UP: Gives player a slow-mo for few seconds, allowing for a brief moment when too much is happening at the same time.
+ **SHOTGUN** - Stable of movement shooter. Punchy, low-range but capable of hitting multiple enemies and having the highest damage output at once.
+ + POWER UP: Dragonbreath shells - sets enemy on fire, doing additional damage over time.
+ **MACHINE GUN** - Automatic gatling gun, perfect tool for mowing through low-health enemies, although not really accurate and eats through ammo pretty fast.
+ + POWER UP: Higher fire rate by plugging in overcharged battery.
### + Pick-Up Items
Items that can be found through the levels. Either littering around for basic needs. Levels can hid some of the supplies in secrets, encouraning exploration of the levels, rewarding player with additional supplies:
 + + Health pick ups: 
 + + + Health vials - adding one point of health. Can overheal the player. Chainsaw power up allow to get more vials.
 + + + First aid kits - 10 health point - pretty often, could be a box of bandages.
 + + + Medbags - 25 health points - rarer, should be put before a encounter with enemies that aren't just put through.
 + + + Sacred Hearts - 100 health points - super rare, almost entirely found before boss fights or in secrets that are diffcult to find.
 + + Ammo pickups:
 + + + Magnum mags - 8 bullets each, 80 max - On beginning plentiful but playing more into the episode, pickups should be rarer.
 + + + Shotgun shells - 10 shells each, 50 max - pretty often, should be main ammo type that's appearing.  
 + + + Bullets case - 50 machine gun each, 500 max - often but not as shotgun.
### + Enemies
+ + Gremlin - fast moving, capable of only melee attacks, low health
+ + Alien Shooter - Projectle launching enemy, capable of running away if too close to a player, moving towards player if too far. If it has clear sight of the enemy - he can shoot at him.
+ + Mummies - Egypt exclusive, melee and throwing stuff at the angle. Slow but tanky. 
### + Controls
 + WSAD - Forward, Backwards, Left and Right movement  
 + Mouse - looking around,
 + Mouse Left Click - Fire,
 + Mouse Right Click - Zoom for the Magnum's scope.
 + Spacebar - Jump
 + C - Crouch
